-./check
I've inserted test which "Wrong password, Good Bye..." 
-ltrace ./check (and press enter/fill in characters several times)

That returnes the following suspicious looking function: strcmp("yourinput1\2\3", "sex")
-./check  and insert: sex

**strcmp = stringcompare / compares strings with eachother*** http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstring/strcmp/

-cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
